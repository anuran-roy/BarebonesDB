BarebonesDB by Anuran Roy (@anuran-roy)

The barebones of a DBMS.

What is it?
> BarebonesDB is a NoSQL style DBMS. Err... barebones of a NoSQL DBMS actually. 

How do I make it work?
> Only Python 3.x is needed. Just FYI, this has been made on Python 3.8

How does it work?
> Here's how:
1. To add data to your DB: "add <YOUR DICTIONARY>". Example: add {"name": "Anuran", "Github": "@anuran-roy"}
2. To get data from yout DB: "get {"must": {<The dictionary of fields that you MUST want>}, "not": {{<The dictionary of fields that you DON'T want>}}}". 
Example: {"must": {"name": "Anuran"}, "not": {"Github": "@anuran-roy"}} will give output "Not found" because there is no entry where name is Anuran and username is not "@anuran-roy" (until you specify it.)
	
A few tips:
> Don't make your dictionary too "deep", i.e, don't nest objects too much. It will slow down the lookup speed.
